	/*Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
	 * Object has traits, characteristics and can carry out specific functions.
	 * 
	 * E.g. DVD player contains:
	 * Properties:
	 * - Height
	 * - Weight
	 * - Width
	 * - Color
	 * - etc.
	 * 
	 * Functionality:
	 * - Decodes
	 * - Play
	 * - Fast Forward
	 * - Rewind
	 * - Pause
	 * - etc.
	 * 
	 * A DVD player, for example, interacts with a DVD (another OBJECT)
	 * 
	 * DVD
	 * Properties:
	 * - Movie Length
	 * - Image
	 * - Size
	 * - etc.
	 * 
	 * Functionality:
	 * - Stores data */
	
	/*Four Pillars of OOP:
	 * 1. Abstraction
	 * 		Exposes essential features of an entity or an object while hiding details that are not as critical.
	 * 			e.g. Triangle
	 * 			e.g. Table
	 * 
	 * 2. Encapsulation
	 * 			e.g. The user only accesses the public pieces of e.g. a car (turn it on, change shift, pedals, etc.)
	 * 
	 * 3. Inheritance
	 * 		Allows objects or classes to inherit from parent classes
	 * 
	 * 4. Polymorphism
	 * 		Animals communicate in different ways
	 * 		The "method" communications can take different forms

	 /* A Class is a tool used to structure code in OOP
	  * A class is similar to a blueprint
	  * An object is the actual product developed from the blueprint.
	  * An object is an Instance of a Class
